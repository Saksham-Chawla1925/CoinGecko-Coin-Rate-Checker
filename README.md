# CoinGecko-Coin-Rate-Checker

This project syncs cryptocurrency market data from the CoinGecko API into Google Sheets using Google Apps Script.

It performs two core tasks:

  1. Current Prices Tab: Updates real-time prices of the top 15 cryptocurrencies every 30 minutes.

  2. Price History Tab: Appends a snapshot of prices every 30 minutes for historical tracking.


üìÇ Google Sheet Structure

	Sheet 1: Current Prices
		| Coin ID | Symbol | Name | Current Price (USD) | Market Cap (USD) | 24h % Change | Last Updated | Last Synced |

	Overwrites every 30 minutes

	Last Synced = timestamp of sync run

	Sheet 2: Price History
		| Timestamp | Coin ID | Symbol | Name | Internal Ref Code | Current Price (USD) | Market Cap (USD) | 24h % Change |


Appends data every 30 minutes

~48 entries per coin per 24 hours
